Issues:
  1. Cheerio isn't going to work in terms of being able to parse rarecaret because rarecaret is a Angular JS app. 
  That means that a regular http request with superagent will just yield a skeleton html tree, when the real part of the html
  tree is javascript injected at a later point in time. 

  2. After doing initial research on osmosis i've found that osmosis is used as both a http library for making requests
    and a parsing library for parsing the html when it is sent back. I wanted to seperate the parsing from the fetching if possible, 
    mainly because osmosis is going to be put inside a function and a function is supposed to do just one thing. If it does to much and an error is thrown
    in this case fetching a url and then parsing the html then its going to be harder to figure out which part of the business logic threw the error,
    was it an error parsing or an error fetching?

Possible Solutions:
  1. Find a library that can wait for the javascript to load. A library that can query rarecaret as if it's a browser.
    I think Osmosis can work like this, but it's been a while since i used it so need to play around with it and do some research
    as well.

  2. It might be possible to only use osmosis as a parsing library and abstract the fetching of the url away. But then again, if osmosis is supposed to 
    act like a browser than it makes sense it would do both. So this isn't really a problem to begin with. Osmosis probably needs to make the request because it 
    has logic that is more complex than just an http request, it mounts the javascript <script> tags it finds in the initial response

So It turns out that my previous concerns are now mute. I dug deeper into how rare caret works and they do return json so no parsing of html is required. In fact, they actually query multiple sites on behalf of the user and return a collection of results from all the sites they have queried. The sites include:
